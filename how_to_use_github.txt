ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "<your_email@must_match_the_one_you_gave_to_github">

	give it an easily remembered passphrase

pbcopy < ./id_rsa.pub

Step 2: add the ssh key to github

https://github.com/settings/ssh

	Add Key by pasting into the appropriate field.
	Set Title as something that tells you what email you used.

Step 3: set up the local repository

cd /path/to/where/you/want/the/LIRA/repository/
git clone git@github.com:vkashyap/LIRA.git

	this will download everything there is on the github repository

git add files
git commit -m "some descriptive text saying what was changed"
